# Pulp 3 CLI Docs

This is the documentation for Pulp 3's command line interface.

Here you can find information about how to install the Pulp 3 CLI, and general usage and syntax information.

Currently `pulp-cli` supports pulpcore and 6 of Pulp's plugins: `pulp_ansible`, `pulp-certguard`, `pulp_container`, `pulp_file`, `pulp_python` and `pulp_rpm`.
See section below for information on how to extend the CLI to support other Pulp plugins.

You can find workflow examples for the Pulp 3 CLI throughout the [plugin documentation](site:help/).
For example, [synchronizing a File repository](site:/pulp_file/docs/user/guides/01-sync/).
